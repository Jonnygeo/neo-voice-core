Neo Voice Core is the voice module for the NeoLegacy system. It enables users to record, upload, and store voice messages tied to memory, emotion, or spiritual guidance. Messages can be saved privately, linked to a child, or scheduled for future delivery.

It supports browser-based recording, Firebase or Arweave storage, optional transcription, and delivery tagging (birthday, posthumous, timeline-specific). This module is part of NeoLegacy’s emotional memory system — where voice becomes presence, and presence becomes legacy.

Neo Voice Core connects with the vault for storage, the message delivery engine for scheduling, and the NeoLegacy dashboard for UI access. ElevenLabs or Whisper may be used for transcription or TTS, but the system is modular.

Use cases include final blessings, daily affirmations, birthday recordings, spiritual teachings, or personalized messages from parent to child over time.
